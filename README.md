Assignment 1.(total cost)
I have done the basic programming in for this assignment.
The program is started by the header file and then main function.
I have taken int and double datatype for book and pen.
After that I have taken the total amount of books and pens .
After that I have added the total price of books and pens to get the  total cost of supplies.
At last the program is returned in the main function.
There was the option to use for loop directly but I thought to take my output stape wise.
The total cost of supply is 48.75
